4	48	Dandy is transforming the massive and antiquated dental industry—an industry worth over $200B. Backed by some of the world’s leading venture capital firms, we’re on an ambitious mission to simplify and modernize every function of the dental practice through technology. As we expand our reach globally, Dandy is building the operating system for dental offices around the world—empowering clinicians and their teams with technology, innovation, and world-class support to achieve more for their practices, their people, and their patients. Revolutionizing the dental industry is hard…and we need help. We're on the hunt for an experienced Senior Data Analyst who can tackle some of our most significant challenges in product. This role is responsible for key aspects of Dandy's business, obsessing over the customer experience to grow recurring revenue, improve customer retention, and enhance our product through increased feature usage. We are looking for a Senior Data Analyst with 5+ years of experience and a quantitative background (Math, Stats, Engineering, or Behavioral Science) who wants to operate as a business owner, not a technical resource. Your responsibilities/opportunities: You aren't here to manage a queue; you're here to drive the product forward. As a Senior Data Analyst, you will: Own the Analytical Roadmap: Serve as the primary point of contact for Product, Design, and Engineering to translate company OKRs into a concrete product data strategy. You don’t wait for questions; you proactively identify friction in the user journey—like feature drop-off—and surface the solution. Define the Metrics Framework: Establish the "Source of Truth" for product success by designing KPIs and dashboards in Hex or Looker. You ensure that when leadership asks about feature performance, the answer is consistent, accurate, and actionable. Drive Causal Impact: Move beyond descriptive reporting to lead end-to-end projects spanning months—from ideation to maintenance. You will design and execute complex A/B experiments and causal inference models in Python to prove what actually drives retention. Lead Product Decision-Making: Distill complex statistical findings into high-leverage narratives for VPs and Directors. You will be a central voice in the room helping leadership make trade-offs between speed, quality, and technical debt. Raise the Bar for the Team: As a senior member of the organization, you will mentor other analysts and provide trusted, instructive code reviews. You will actively improve our tools and processes to help the broader team move faster. Who You Are & How We Work: At Dandy, "how" we work is as important as the code we write: Strategic Partnership, Not Ticket-Taking: We don’t have a service desk. You are an owner, not a renter. Using #FirstPrincipleThinking, you interrogate the business problem behind a request to ensure we’re solving for the right outcome. You are expected to challenge assumptions and steer stakeholders toward insights that move our OKRs. Impact Over Complexity: We don’t build models because they are intellectually stimulating. You #DeliverQualityResults by choosing the simplest, most effective tool for the job—whether that’s a Python script or a targeted SQL query. You are expected to use LLMs and automation to kill off repetitive tasks and "tinkering," freeing you to focus on high-level problem solving. Bias for #DandySpeed: We prioritize progress over perfection. You have the statistical intuition to know when an analysis is "directionally correct" and ready to ship. You avoid the trap of diminishing returns, preferring to establish guardrails, move fast, and iterate. "Walk the Floor" Mentality: You don't just live in BigQuery. You solve problems by recognizing how work gets done in the real world—whether that's in a dental office or a lab. You operate at the lowest level of detail, questioning metrics when they don't match reality (like 3D scan metadata or support logs) to uncover the true root cause. Bonus points: Strong customer empathy, particularly for dentists Have experience turning vague business problems into statistical rigorous analyses & solutions (e.g. causal inference, predictive modeling) Interest in working and learning in an earlier stage company where we’re still working out some of the basics Experience in Hex, Looker, and dbt Req ID: J-852 For full-time positions, Dandy offers a wide range of best-in-class, comprehensive, and inclusive benefits tailored to each country where we operate. Our local benefits packages typically include healthcare, dental, mental health support, parental planning resources, retirement savings options, and generous paid time off—ensuring our team members are supported no matter where they live and work. Dandy is proud to be an equal-opportunity employer. We are committed to building a diverse and inclusive culture that celebrates authenticity to win as one. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, marital status, disability, protected veteran status, citizenship or immigration status, or any other legally protected characteristics. Dandy also fully complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). We are dedicated to embracing challenges and creating an accessible, inclusive workplace for all individuals.

26	83	About the company: The mining industry has steadily become worse at finding new ore deposits, requiring >10X more capital to make discoveries compared to 30 years ago. The easy-to-find, near-surface deposits have largely been found, and the industry has chronically under-invested in new exploration technology, relying on the manual techniques of yesteryear – even as demand accelerates for copper, lithium, and other metals to build electric vehicles, renewable energy, and data centers. KoBold builds AI models for mineral exploration and deploys those models—alongside our novel sensors—to guide decisions on KoBold-owned-and-operated exploration programs. In the six years since founding, KoBold has become by far both the largest independent mineral exploration company and the largest exploration technology developer. Our data scientists and software engineers, who come from leading technology companies, jointly lead exploration programs with our renowned exploration geologists. KoBold has proven its first discovery with materially less capital than the industry average and found one of the best copper deposits ever discovered: the copper is far more concentrated than the global average of copper mines, and this asset alone is expected to generate meaningful revenue for decades. KoBold has a portfolio of more than 60 other projects, each of which has the potential for another high-quality discovery. KoBold is privately held; investors include institutional asset managers T. Rowe Rice and Canada Pension Plan Investments; technology venture capitalists Andreessen Horowitz, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, BOND Capital, and Standard Investments; and natural resources companies Equinor, BHP, and Mitsubishi. About The Role: In this role, you will develop state of the art instruments to collect data to guide our exploration programs. You will simulate, characterize, and calibrate sensor performance and design new data acquisition systems. Working with vendors and partners, you will build hardware and work with our operations staff to deploy it in the field. With this sensor data and other data sources at KoBold, you will build models and apply a wide range of scientific computing, statistical, and physics-based methods to find places where there is evidence of ore-forming processes at work and to predict the locations of ore-grade mineralization in 2D and 3D. You will help build a worldwide dataset that underlies our exploration program, with careful attention to identifying and quantifying uncertainty in the data and in our predictions. You will be creating models and developing software to accelerate discovery of critical battery metals. You will join an outstanding team of data scientists and engineers and will work closely with KoBold’s world-renowned geoscientists to incorporate our best understanding of the chemical and physical processes that create ore deposits. Working with your geoscience colleagues, you will identify new opportunities and technologies for geophysical data collection, create 2D and 3D geologic predictions, identify exploration targets, design field programs to collect data, and use that data to reduce the uncertainty in our predictions and guide the next phase of field work. Ultimately, your role is to help KoBold make valuable discoveries by building and deploying next generation hardware and using data tools to solve scientific problems. As one of the early members of this team, you will help build these tools from the ground up. Responsibilities of this position include: Technical execution Design, develop, and deploy new mineral exploration data collection instruments and methods. Help develop KoBold’s proprietary software exploration tools. Find and curate a wide variety of geospectral, geophysical, geochemical, geologic, and geographic data and integrate it into KoBold’s proprietary data system. Build models to make statistically valid predictions about the locations of compositional anomalies within the Earth’s crust. Create effective visualizations for evaluating model performance and enabling rapid interaction with the underlying data and key features. Develop and apply a range of data processing, statistical, and physics-based techniques to geoscientific data — from computer vision to geophysical inversions — and use the results to guide our targeting efforts and inform our acquisition and exploration decisions. Present to and collaborate with our external partners and stakeholders. Push the state of the art in analysis capabilities by implementing statistically rigorous spatially aware clustering, anomaly detection, and other analysis methods Collaborate with data scientists, geoscientists and engineers to invent and deploy algorithms that combine large and complex data sets for mineral exploration and discoveries Qualifications Demonstrated ability to quickly absorb and synthesize complex information, with a track record of high intellectual rigor in a professional setting.

That’s why we’re looking for passionate, innovative, solutions-oriented people to join our team. We thrive on providing exceptional customer service and we look for team members with an entrepreneurial spirit and a passion to build successful partnerships with our clients. Because at the end of the day our goal is to help our partners businesses run better. At TriumphPay we are building the transportation payments network for the future. Our software touches a combined $37.1B in annualized freight volume, representing over 20% of the brokered freight market in the U.S. TriumphPay’s customers are using our products to solve real world problems. This is both exciting and also an incredible responsibility. We are looking for experienced ML engineers to join our team of 35+ engineers. If you join TriumphPay, you will work closely in a small, cross-functional team of 3-4 people focused on our AI/ML systems. Our teams operate with a high degree of autonomy, allowing you to take ownership of projects from ideation to deployment. You’ll collaborate closely with product managers and other stakeholders to understand customer pain points and deliver impactful solutions that support critical features. Our engineering team is fully remote and believes strongly in work-life balance. A Day In The Life: There’s no defined template that teams at TriumphPay follow, allowing each team to build the day that lets them perform at their best. Typically, a team has a morning standup allowing them to catchup on what happened yesterday, and ensure there’s a plan in place for the day ahead. You’ll work with our product group and members of the sales team to ensure we’re building the tools our customers need to succeed. The Tech: The AI/ML team works primarily in a mixture of Python and Clojure for ML experimentation, data processing, and deployments, with Ruby and other languages used for integrating models into customer-facing applications. Python and Ruby make up the majority of our work, with Clojure being third. Occasionally, the AI/ML team handles integration work in Ruby or other languages directly when it enables faster delivery of value, though this work may also be handed off to feature development teams. We use PySpark for most of our data processing, AWS SageMaker Studio for model development and validation, and PyTorch + HuggingFace for deep learning work. Model inference runs on a mix of FastAPI and Clojure applications, depending on the model type. Our ML systems process more than 1 million documents per day through hundreds of models requiring robust pipelines to handle noisy, unstructured data with high precision at scale. You'll work on building, deploying, and integrating models that can generalize across diverse document formats and adapt to evolving customer needs. Our models must operate within strict latency requirements to ensure seamless customer experiences, while maintaining high performance in extracting and classifying data from complex, unstructured documents. We are constantly exploring new techniques in deep learning, transfer learning, and model optimization to improve the accuracy and efficiency of our systems. We know that good engineers can pick up new tools and languages on the job and we don't expect candidates to be familiar with all of these technologies. We love curious individuals who believe they can always improve, and we know that good developers are capable of picking up new languages and tools. Engineers are provided a top of the line MacBook to do their work, and you’ll have access to all the necessary tooling to do the non-coding parts of your job (Zoom, Slack, etc.). To succeed in this role, you should be: - Curious. You aren't content with the status quo and know that we can always improve. - Data Driven. You seek evidence to support hypotheses and identify optimal solutions within problem constraints accounting for sources of error and uncertainty. - Collaborative. You can work with others to improve a solution iteratively factoring in new information from outside perspectives. - Empathetic. Your designs are influenced by a deep understanding of the customers' needs. - A strong communicator. You will proactively communicate issues and trade-offs with team members to support alignment and fast decision making. - Be an outstanding developer. Your peers should recognize you as one of the best and the brightest developers they have worked with.

81	140	Senior Software Engineer, Scientific Computing About the Company The mining industry has steadily become worse at finding new ore deposits, requiring >10X more capital to make discoveries compared to 30 years ago. The easy-to-find, near-surface deposits have largely been found, and the industry has chronically under-invested in new exploration technology, relying on the manual techniques of yesteryear – even as demand accelerates for copper, lithium, and other metals to build electric vehicles, renewable energy, and data centers. KoBold builds AI models for mineral exploration and deploys those models—alongside our novel sensors—to guide decisions on KoBold-owned-and-operated exploration programs. In the six years since founding, KoBold has become by far both the largest independent mineral exploration company and the largest exploration technology developer. Our data scientists and software engineers, who come from leading technology companies, jointly lead exploration programs with our renowned exploration geologists. KoBold has proven its first discovery with materially less capital than the industry average and found one of the best copper deposits ever discovered: the copper is far more concentrated than the global average of copper mines, and this asset alone is expected to generate meaningful revenue for decades. KoBold has a portfolio of more than 60 other projects, each of which has the potential for another high-quality discovery. KoBold is privately held; investors include institutional asset managers T. Rowe Price and Canada Pension Plan Investments; technology venture capitalists Andreessen Horowitz, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, BOND Capital, Durable Capital, StepStone, and Standard Investments; and natural resources companies Equinor, BHP, and Mitsubishi. About the Role At KoBold we believe that a modern scientific computing stack will enable systematic mineral exploration and materially improve our rate of mineral discovery. This role is a key ingredient to this strategy. As a member of our scientific computing team, you will apply software engineering and machine learning to remote-sensing, drillhole, imaging, geophysics and other mineral exploration data in order to build scalable ML systems to help make high-speed, high-quality decisions for our mineral exploration projects. Collaborating with our exceptional team of data scientists and geologists, you will tackle complex scientific problems head-on and collectively pave the way for discoveries of vital energy transition metals like lithium, copper, nickel, and cobalt. Together we can shape the future of mineral exploration and contribute to building a sustainable world. Responsibilities Architect, implement, and maintain foundational scientific computing libraries that will be used in KoBold’s mineral exploration analyses. Build tooling to increase the velocity of our machine learning progress, including enabling rapid prototyping in Jupyter notebooks; build experimentation, evaluation, and simulation frameworks; turning successful R&D into robust, scalable ML pipelines; and organizing models and their outputs for repeatability and discoverability. In collaboration with data scientists, build models to make statistically valid predictions about the locations of economic concentrations of ore metals within the Earth’s crust. Apply–and coach team members to use–engineering best practices such as writing robust, testable and composable code Collaborate with data scientists, geoscientists and engineers to invent the modern scientific computing stack for mineral exploration Occasional travel to exploration sites around the world to observe the impact of scientific computing on KoBold’s exploration products and design new technologies to further discovery. Travel is approximately twice per year depending on project needs. Qualifications Our ideal candidate will have: At least 5 years of experience as a software engineer, data scientist or ML engineer, though most great candidates will have closer to 10. Track record of building production quality data processing solutions or tooling that have delivered business value Proficiency with foundational concepts of ML, including statistical, traditional and deep-learning approaches Proficiency in Python, ideally including array-based packages such as xarray and numpy Deep experience with measured scientific data Experience in visualizing scientific data for domain experts Experience in MLops and in the making of robust ML systems Drive to increase the velocity and effectiveness of our data scientists in both experimental and production workflows Capacity to dive deep on novel challenging problems in applying ML to mineral exploration, including understanding a complex domain of geology and mineral exploration practices as well as working with limited, disparate and noisy data sources Collaborative attitude to work with stakeholders with different backgrounds (data scientists, geoscientists, software engineers, operations) Work practices and motivation: Ability to take ownership and responsibility of large projects. Intellectual curiosity and eagerness to learn about all aspects of mineral exploration, particularly in the geology domain. Open to working directly with geologists in the field. Enjoys constantly learning such that you are driving insights and innovations. Ability to explain technical problems to and collaborate on solutions with domain experts who aren’t software developers. A strong communicator who enjoys working with colleagues across the company. Excitement about joining a fast-growing early-stage company, comfort with a dynamic work environment, and eagerness to take on a range of responsibilities. Keen not just to build cool technology, but to figure out what technical product to build to best achieve the business objectives of the company. Ability to independently prioritize multiple tasks effectively. KoBold Metals is an equal opportunity workplace and an affirmative action employer. We are committed to equal employment opportunity for people of any race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, marital status, national origin, age, citizenship, disability, or veteran status.
