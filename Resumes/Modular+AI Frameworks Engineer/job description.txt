United States / Canada MAX Platform Remote Full-time About Modular At Modular, we’re on a mission to revolutionize AI infrastructure by systematically rebuilding the AI software stack from the ground up. Our team, made up of industry leaders and experts, is building cutting-edge, modular infrastructure that simplifies AI development and deployment. By rethinking the complexities of AI systems, we’re empowering everyone to unlock AI’s full potential and tackle some of the world’s most pressing challenges. If you’re passionate about shaping the future of AI and creating tools that make a real difference in people’s lives, we want you on our team. You can read about our culture and careers to understand how we work and what we value. About the role: Modular is looking for strong software engineers to work on the next generation of AI frameworks. We’re looking for an AI Frameworks Engineer who treats frameworks as both product and platform - someone who can reason about developer experience and the ruthless physics of memory, bandwidth, and latency. We are looking for candidates with strong teamwork skills who are passionate about building high quality APIs and solutions for ML practitioners to help build a modern AI framework that makes heterogeneous compute feel coherent, defines crisp tensor semantics, bridges eager and compiled execution, and sets a new bar for performance and portability. You won’t be maintaining legacy. You’ll be inventing the future — and shipping it. LOCATION: Candidates based in the US or Canada are welcome to apply. To support growth and collaboration, those in earlier career stages work in a hybrid capacity at our Los Altos, CA office (minimum 2 days per week on-site) with relocation assistance provided for out-of-state candidates. Senior members have both in office or remote flexibility. All new hires complete onboarding in-person in our Los Altos, CA office. What you will do: Craft and implement new MAX framework and runtime features atop our MLIR-based compiler architecture. Develop interoperability solutions with various frameworks, and participate in the design of Modular’s internal stack. Develop user-facing ML development infrastructure, APIs and language extensions. Dream up and realize what the next generation NN framework should look like, how it will map to the heterogeneity of the world to make GPUs, CPUs, and accelerators sing in harmony. Participate in design discussions and code reviews to uphold high engineering standards. Collaborate and engage with the Modular core teams, researchers, and the external Modular and open source community to support high-quality contributions and foster a welcoming, inclusive environment. Mentor junior engineers and support their growth. What you bring to the table: 4+ years sculpting AI frameworks or runtime implementations. Hands-on mastery of Python, data structures and algorithms. Experience developing machine learning frameworks and APIs like PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX, JAX, or similar. Familiarity with compiler infrastructure and the willingness to master them quickly. A deep curiosity for deep neural networks. Good understanding of ML-specific representations like computation graphs. A collaborative mindset, intellectual curiosity, and a drive to solve complex technical challenges as part of a high-performing team. Clear and effective communication skills, both written and verbal. Strong alignment with Modular’s cultural values and a desire to help build a thoughtful, inclusive engineering culture. Helpful but not required: Contributions to PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn or other real-world languages. Experience with HPC or accelerator ecosystems (CUDA, SYCL, OpenCL, etc.). Familiarity with production-system-LLMs or other Transformer architectures. An advanced degree in Computer Science or a related field or equivalent experience.
