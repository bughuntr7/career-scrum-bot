We truly value work-life balance. Our distributed team offers unlimited PTO and a flexible work-from-home policy.
About the Role
As a Tech Lead in AI Products, your responsibilities will vary across the development lifecycle, and include providing solutions architecture and vision for existing solutions, supporting new feature development and testing, and preparing for release of high-quality, deployment-ready code.
AI Product Tech Leads must have strong stakeholder-facing skills to translate business problems into AI solution designs, reference architectures, and implementation roadmaps.
AI Product Tech Leads are responsible for architecting the transition of AI projects from Proof of Concept to robust, production-ready solutions that transform our business offerings.
Conduct lightweight sprint planning and review sessions, prioritizing features and managing project timelines.
Write, review, and ensure the quality of production-ready code, setting high standards for the team.
You seek deep understanding and take ownership of the impact your technical decision-making has on driving costs for the firm and/or clients.
Oversee the implementation of testing protocols, including smoke tests and unit tests, to maintain high-quality outputs, in collaboration with members of the AI Platform and Infrastructure engineers.
Prepare and refine Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and release documentation in preparation for production deployment; collaborate with Enablement team to create user upskilling materials that support effective use and drive adoption of AI solutions and latest features.
Lead ethical reviews and risk/security evaluations to ensure compliance and safeguard our solutions.
Engage with business stakeholders and proactively identify big picture improvements that benefit the client, product, and/or development team.
Act as a career coach, fostering the growth and development of 3+ team members through knowledge-sharing, constructive code review, and by setting the standard for code quality and research best practices.
Willingness to travel domestically to meet client needs.
