Cleerly has created a new standard of care for heart disease through value-based, AI-driven precision diagnostic solutions with the goal of helping prevent heart attacks. Our technology goes beyond traditional measures of heart disease by enabling comprehensive quantification and characterization of atherosclerosis, or plaque buildup, in each of the heart arteries. Cleerly’s solutions are supported by more than a decade of performing some of the world’s largest clinical trials to identify important findings beyond symptoms that increase a person’s risk of heart attacks.

Our people use Google Workspace (GMail, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides), Slack, Confluence/Jira, and Zoom Video, prior experience in these areas is a plus.
