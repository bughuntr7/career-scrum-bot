AT CASTOR, WE DRIVE FASTER, SMARTER MEDICAL RESEARCH



Faster, more diverse clinical trials help extend the human health span, increase health equity and provide a greater return on investment for life sciences. That's our mission.



We strive to improve the clinical trial experience for patients, sites and sponsors, using technology to accelerate every step of the clinical trial journey.



Our modular clinical trial platform enables the capture and re-use of research data from anywhere, anytime and helps optimize each activity in the clinical trial journey by reducing human effort with technology. From recruitment to monitoring, we help make it easier to design and deploy trials, enroll and engage patients, collect data and analyze results.



Next to being very purpose-driven, we are proud of our caring company culture. We follow our values diligently and take the well-being of each Castorian seriously.
