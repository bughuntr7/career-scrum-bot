The Role We are seeking an Applied Scientist with a strong software engineering foundation to build the next generation of legal and financial AI. In this role, you will move beyond theoretical knowledge and focus on the practical application of building, scaling, and maintaining robust, production-grade AI systems. You will work on a variety of initiatives, from complex document understanding to the development of sophisticated AI agents that will redefine how estate planning is done. Your primary focus will be on the "how"—how to effectively leverage state-of-the-art models in a real-world application, how to build scalable and secure systems around their limitations, and how to ship products that deliver real value to our users. What You Will Do: Design, build, and deploy production-grade systems leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) from providers like OpenAI, Google (Vertex AI), and Anthropic. Develop and scale end-to-end applications for complex document understanding, focusing on textual, financial, and tabular data. This includes building sophisticated, high-precision RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems that are battle-tested for production traffic. Implement robust guardrails, validation layers, and monitoring to preemptively address model limitations, such as hallucinations, both in offline evaluation and online production environments. Engineer and deploy complex, multi-step AI agents, with a focus on creating agentic workflows that are scalable, maintainable, and secure, especially when handling highly sensitive client data. Own projects from conception to deployment, making key architectural decisions and ensuring the systems you build meet stringent requirements for latency, precision, and recall. Build scalable ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipelines to process and prepare complex datasets for AI model consumption. Collaborate closely with product managers, software engineers, and other scientists to build tools, define metrics, and continuously improve the end-to-end quality of our AI systems. Align your technical work with business outcomes, effectively communicating the impact and performance of the systems you build to stakeholders. Qualifications: A degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related quantitative field (or equivalent practical experience). Proven experience building and shipping software in a production environment. You are a builder at heart and have a portfolio of projects (personal or professional) that have seen real user traffic. Strong software engineering fundamentals, including data structures, algorithms, system design, and writing clean, maintainable code. Hands-on experience building, deploying, and maintaining production-level agent systems using frameworks like Agent Development Kit (ADK) or LangGraph. Proficiency in Python and a strong aptitude for working in a polyglot environment that may include TypeScript, C#, etc. Experience developing applications that consume and integrate APIs from major AI providers (e.g., Google Vertex AI, Azure OpenAI). Preferred Qualifications (Bonus Points): 5+ years of professional experience writing production code and shipping AI/ML-powered features. Demonstrated experience building and scaling agentic workflows. Extra points if you have dealt with highly sensitive data as part of these agents. Experience working in a highly regulated industry such as LegalTech, FinTech, or HealthTech. You understand the unique challenges and importance of security and privacy. Experience with MLOps, including setting up training pipelines, monitoring model performance in production, and implementing CI/CD for ML systems. Familiarity with techniques for ensuring data privacy and security in AI systems (e.g., identifying and sanitizing PII). Benefits & Perks Competitive salary. Hybrid work arrangement if located in the Phoenix or New York area; otherwise, fully remote. We also meet together in person several times a year. Excellent medical, dental, and vision insurance options, with low-cost premium structures that demonstrate our commitment to offering great value to our employees. 100% company-paid basic life insurance, short-term and long-term disability insurance. 100% paid parental leave upon eligibility. Company equity managed through Carta. 401k with match and 100% vesting upon hire. Flexible PTO in an environment where taking time off to relax or recharge is supported and encouraged. Take time off for holidays—and yes, your birthday counts too. Celebrate, relax, and recharge without thinking twice.
