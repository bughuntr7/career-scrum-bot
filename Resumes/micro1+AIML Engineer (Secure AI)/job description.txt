AI/ML Engineer (Secure AI) Core team $300K - $400K/yr compensation Required Skills Python LLMs AWS LangChain CI/CD Job Description Job Title: AI/ML Engineer (Secure AI) Job Type: Full-time Location: Remote About Us: micro1 is the end-to-end human data infrastructure behind AGI. Our AI recruiter model is used by frontier AI labs and Fortune 10s to source, vet, and deploy PhDs and professors from the world’s top universities at scale. These experts are placed directly into the training loops of the most advanced AI systems, powering the breakthroughs that move models forward. Our data platform converts their expertise into high-signal training datasets, and our talent management tooling measures, routes, and improves performance at scale. Role We’re looking for an AI/ML Engineer to build and ship secure, production-grade AI and agentic systems used in high-assurance environments. You’ll work at the intersection of LLMs, agentic architectures, and secure cloud infrastructure, owning systems end-to-end—from research prototypes to hardened deployments. What You’ll Do Design and ship secure AI and agentic systems using Python, LLMs, LangChain/LangGraph, and modern cloud platforms. Build multi-agent architectures, including orchestration, tool use, prompt engineering, and RAG pipelines. Own data and training infrastructure: pipelines, ETL, metadata, ontologies, and evaluation workflows. Integrate frontier AI platforms (e.g., enterprise and government-grade LLM providers) into production systems. Build and maintain production APIs, SDKs, and CI/CD pipelines with strong security and reliability guarantees. Apply secure-by-default engineering practices across code, cloud infrastructure, and deployment workflows. Collaborate closely with engineers, researchers, and operators—communicating clearly and documenting systems thoroughly. What We’re Looking For Strong Python engineering background with ownership of systems from design to production. Hands-on experience with LLMs, agentic systems, LangChain/LangGraph, prompt engineering, and tool-augmented agents. Experience deploying systems on secure cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS GovCloud, Azure IL5+, GCP Gov). Deep familiarity with data pipelines, ETL, metadata systems, and structured data modeling. Experience building REST APIs, integrating SDKs, and automating deployments via CI/CD. Comfort operating in high-assurance, regulated environments with strict security and compliance requirements. Clear communicator who works well across technical and non-technical teams. Nice to Have Experience deploying AI systems in government or regulated enterprise environments. Familiarity with Vertex AI, Bedrock, or similar managed AI platforms. Background in security, compliance, or high-reliability systems. Experience scaling agentic systems from prototype to sustained production use.
