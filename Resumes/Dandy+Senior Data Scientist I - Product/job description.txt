Dandy is transforming the massive and antiquated dental industry—an industry worth over $200B. Backed by some of the world’s leading venture capital firms, we’re on an ambitious mission to simplify and modernize every function of the dental practice through technology. As we expand our reach globally, Dandy is building the operating system for dental offices around the world—empowering clinicians and their teams with technology, innovation, and world-class support to achieve more for their practices, their people, and their patients. Revolutionizing the dental industry is hard…and we need help. We're on the hunt for an experienced Senior Data Analyst who can tackle some of our most significant challenges in product. This role is responsible for key aspects of Dandy's business, obsessing over the customer experience to grow recurring revenue, improve customer retention, and enhance our product through increased feature usage. We are looking for a Senior Data Analyst with 5+ years of experience and a quantitative background (Math, Stats, Engineering, or Behavioral Science) who wants to operate as a business owner, not a technical resource. Your responsibilities/opportunities: You aren't here to manage a queue; you're here to drive the product forward. As a Senior Data Analyst, you will: Own the Analytical Roadmap: Serve as the primary point of contact for Product, Design, and Engineering to translate company OKRs into a concrete product data strategy. You don’t wait for questions; you proactively identify friction in the user journey—like feature drop-off—and surface the solution. Define the Metrics Framework: Establish the "Source of Truth" for product success by designing KPIs and dashboards in Hex or Looker. You ensure that when leadership asks about feature performance, the answer is consistent, accurate, and actionable. Drive Causal Impact: Move beyond descriptive reporting to lead end-to-end projects spanning months—from ideation to maintenance. You will design and execute complex A/B experiments and causal inference models in Python to prove what actually drives retention. Lead Product Decision-Making: Distill complex statistical findings into high-leverage narratives for VPs and Directors. You will be a central voice in the room helping leadership make trade-offs between speed, quality, and technical debt. Raise the Bar for the Team: As a senior member of the organization, you will mentor other analysts and provide trusted, instructive code reviews. You will actively improve our tools and processes to help the broader team move faster. Who You Are & How We Work: At Dandy, "how" we work is as important as the code we write: Strategic Partnership, Not Ticket-Taking: We don’t have a service desk. You are an owner, not a renter. Using #FirstPrincipleThinking, you interrogate the business problem behind a request to ensure we’re solving for the right outcome. You are expected to challenge assumptions and steer stakeholders toward insights that move our OKRs. Impact Over Complexity: We don’t build models because they are intellectually stimulating. You #DeliverQualityResults by choosing the simplest, most effective tool for the job—whether that’s a Python script or a targeted SQL query. You are expected to use LLMs and automation to kill off repetitive tasks and "tinkering," freeing you to focus on high-level problem solving. Bias for #DandySpeed: We prioritize progress over perfection. You have the statistical intuition to know when an analysis is "directionally correct" and ready to ship. You avoid the trap of diminishing returns, preferring to establish guardrails, move fast, and iterate. "Walk the Floor" Mentality: You don't just live in BigQuery. You solve problems by recognizing how work gets done in the real world—whether that's in a dental office or a lab. You operate at the lowest level of detail, questioning metrics when they don't match reality (like 3D scan metadata or support logs) to uncover the true root cause. Bonus points: Strong customer empathy, particularly for dentists Have experience turning vague business problems into statistical rigorous analyses & solutions (e.g. causal inference, predictive modeling) Interest in working and learning in an earlier stage company where we’re still working out some of the basics Experience in Hex, Looker, and dbt Req ID: J-852 For full-time positions, Dandy offers a wide range of best-in-class, comprehensive, and inclusive benefits tailored to each country where we operate. Our local benefits packages typically include healthcare, dental, mental health support, parental planning resources, retirement savings options, and generous paid time off—ensuring our team members are supported no matter where they live and work.
