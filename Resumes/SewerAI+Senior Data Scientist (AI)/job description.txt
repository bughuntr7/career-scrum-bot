About SewerAI Corporation

SewerAI is transforming underground infrastructure management through AI-powered inspection and risk analysis. Our platform helps contractors, engineering firms, and utilities unlock valuable insights from sewer inspection data—turning hours of manual video review into actionable intelligence in minutes. After doubling our customer base over the past year, we're now entering an exciting phase of accelerated growth.

About the Role
We're looking for a Senior Data Scientist to join our AI team and work on applied machine learning for sewer infrastructure. In this role, you'll develop anomaly detection systems, time series forecasting models, and predictive analytics that help utilities anticipate and prevent infrastructure failures.

You'll work closely with our engineering and data teams to build ML systems that analyze sensor data, detect anomalies, and deliver actionable insights to our customers.

What You'll Work On
Anomaly Detection — Develop models to identify unusual patterns and potential issues in sewer infrastructure data

Time Series Forecasting — Build predictive models for maintenance scheduling and infrastructure health predictions

ML Model Development — Design, train, and iterate on ML models for sewer-specific applications

Data Analysis & Pipelines — Build pipelines for processing and analyzing infrastructure data at scale

Dashboards & Reporting — Create visualizations and reports in Hex to surface insights for stakeholders

Required Technical Skills
Python — Deep experience with pandas, scikit-learn, and statistical analysis

Deep Learning Frameworks — PyTorch or TensorFlow for advanced modeling

SQL — Complex queries, window functions, analytical queries

Time Series Analysis — Forecasting techniques, trend analysis, seasonality handling, signal processing

Anomaly Detection — Statistical and ML-based anomaly detection techniques

Data Stack — Hex, dbt, ClickHouse

Nice-to-Have Skills
Infrastructure or IoT domain experience

Sewer/Water industry experience or knowledge

Sensor data analysis

MLOps experience (model deployment, monitoring)

Cloud platforms (AWS)

What We're Looking For
4-6 years of applied machine learning experience

Strong statistical and ML fundamentals

Experience with time series analysis or anomaly detection

Knowledge of Bayesian statistics and/or Bayesian optimization

Experience creating and applying custom metrics to complex datasets and problems

Collaborative mindset — you enjoy working across teams

Clear communicator — you can explain complex ML concepts to non-technical stakeholders

What You'll Gain
Impact — Your models directly improve infrastructure maintenance for cities and utilities

Modern Stack — Work with a modern data and ML stack (Hex, dbt, ClickHouse, PyTorch)

Growth — Expand your skills across applied ML in a high-impact domain

Ownership — Shape the direction of our predictive analytics capabilities as we scale

Compensation: $150,000-$180,000

Benefits include:

Medical, Dental, Vision, Basic Life, 401(k), and more

Unlimited PTO
